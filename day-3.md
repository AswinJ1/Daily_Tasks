  - Nested flexbox structures for complex layouts
  - Final touches on responsive design techniques
- **Project**: YouTube Replication
  - Core layout is mostly complete
  - Small refinements left for finishing touches

## Next Steps
- Finalize remaining details on the YouTube replication project.
- Start learning **JavaScript fundamentals** to introduce interactivity into projects moving forward.

## Notes
